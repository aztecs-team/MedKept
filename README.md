# MedKept

Ever wondered why should we need to submit our medical report to the receptionist and how they managed to loose it? Well, we have a solution for you! Our product Medkept is a medical report management system that allows you to keep track of your medical reports and using blockchain technology, and also allows the report to be visible to only the doctor who needs it and the patient whom it concerns.
